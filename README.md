GitGrade API & Analysis Engine 🚀A Hackathon Project for Intelligent GitHub Repository Grading and ImprovementGitGrade is an intelligent backend service that analyzes any public GitHub repository, assigns a numerical "Grade" (out of 100), generates an executive summary, and provides a prioritized roadmap for improvement—all powered by Google's Gemini AI.The service is built on FastAPI and is deployed on Render, featuring robust authentication and a custom Keep-Alive solution to ensure zero cold-start delays. Key FeaturesAI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes the Gemini 2.5-Flash model to critically review repository structure, code quality, and documentation.Repository Grading: Assigns a clear, quantifiable score (e.g., 92/100) to measure project health.Improvement Roadmap: Generates actionable, categorized steps (e.g., QUALITY ASSURANCE, DOCUMENTATION) for the owner to follow.Google OAuth: Secure and seamless login using Google for user authentication.PDF Report Generation: Creates professional, downloadable analysis reports using FPDF.Robust Email Service: Sends the generated reports reliably via SendGrid's HTTP API, bypassing common cloud hosting (Render) firewall issues that blocked standard SMTP connections.Zero Cold Start: Implements a custom Keep-Alive Thread to prevent the Render Free Tier service from sleeping after 15 minutes, ensuring instant response times for end-users.
